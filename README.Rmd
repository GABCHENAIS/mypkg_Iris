# mypkg

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `mypkg` is to learn how to create a package and how to use GitHub.

I want to create a conflict because I like arguing...

## Installation

You can install the released version of mypkg_Iris from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mypkg")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IrisGanser/mypkg_Iris")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the function `mylog` in `mypkg`:

```{r example}
library(mypkg)
x <- 1:10
mypkg::mylog(x)
```
